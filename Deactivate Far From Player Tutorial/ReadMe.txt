UPDATE:
There is an update video for the above tutorial available here:

The updated scripts from the new video have been uploaded as 'V2' and the original scripts have been left as-is. To use the V2 scripts, you'll need to change the name back to remove the 'V2', or update the script to reflect the new name, else they won't compile in Unity.
